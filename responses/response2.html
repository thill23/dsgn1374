				<h1>The Web Designer...</h1>
				<p>This article written by Charmaine Li is a very insightful look at the work of critic Jon Lucas. I found his quote in the beginning of the article very intersting “Once in a while, I’ll see an element on a website and I can tell a human made that decision. Even though this medium is so digital and stark and you have an LED light shining directly into your eyes, there’s still something human that can be communicated through it.” It really set the tone for the work shared by Charmaine throughout. You can tell that Lucas can really see past the digital aspect of online art (weather it’s web design or something else) and understand more about the designer who made the art he’s looking at. I think he has a grand respect for people who are willing to put themselves out there and give us something to look at and appreciate. I also really like his final quote in the article saying “You have to have a sense of humor to live with the web, it’s important to keep things light and casual and to remember, at the end of the day, this is just a piece of metal and plastic sitting on your lap.” I think that this really showcases his personality and style, and I really appreciate the work he’s doing.</p>
