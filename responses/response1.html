				<h1>Lo and Behold</h1>
				<p>Ted is clearly seeing a vision that many of us who use writing tools cannot, and that is the fact that there is no “good” writing tool/software. His vision of a completely annotated way of writing, citing, uploading content is an absolute dream for someone like me (a college student) who is constantly writing papers and responses for professors. Before I came to the graphic design program I was a part of the Child and Youth Care program at the college and  had to write multiple papers per week, with citations that were not always easy to find. So having something like Ted is envisioning would be a complete game changer! I think the amazing Warner Herzog did a fantastic job in this interview and has easily compelled me to watch his film in entirety.</p>
