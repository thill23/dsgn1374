		<p>Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within <span class="new-color">THE SOUND OF SILENCE.</p>
	<h3>SILENCE</h3>

		<p>In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched <span class="new-color">THE SOUND OF SILENCE.</p>
<h3>SILENCE</h3>
		<p>And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb <span class="new-color">THE SOUND OF SILENCE.</span></p>
<h3>SILENCE</h3>

		<p>"Fools, " said I, "You do not know
Silence, like a cancer, grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words, like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells, of <span class="new-color">OF SILENCE.<p>
	<h3>SILENCE</h3>

		<p>And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
And whispered in <span class="new-color">THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE.<p>

		<h3>SILENCE</h3>
