		<section>
		<h4>Q- What school are you currently attending? And why did you pick it?</h4>
		<p>A- I am attending Brock University. I chose this school because it was close, which made it affordable to stay at home and commute rather than live on a campus further away.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- What program are you currently taking?</h4>
		<p>A- I am in my fourth year of the concurrent education program at Brock University. I am taking a major in french and a minor in biology. </p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- How did you find the transition from highschool to university?</h4>
		<p>A- It was pretty easy to be honest. Most of my first year courses were very similar to the ones I took in highschool, which made the trasition easier then most. I also found a job on campus. That made it easy to meet new people and stay involved.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- Why did you decide to become a teacher?</h4>
		<p>A- While I was growing up teaching others was a passion of mine. And after spending my first year in the kinesiology program I realized that teaching was the only career path I could see myself having for the rest of my life!</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- What are some challenges that you are having in your program?</h4>
		<p>A- The hardest part about university classes is being 1 person in a class of [often] 100 plus peers. You have to work a lot harder to get direct help from the teachers compared to highschool. It can be a real issue to fall into a routine of barely scrapping by without talking to a teacher when you need to; and when you don't they tend to view you as "just another face in the crowd".</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- What are some of your favorite parts about being in this program?</h4>
		<p>A- I love the knowledge and skills I learn on a daily basis. It is helping me both now, and in the future. I am also learning tons about french from around the world, and not just in Canada; which I find very fascinating. I know that [in the future] being culturally aware will better connect me with my students.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h4>
		<p>A- 5 years from now I will have finished my schooling and will hopefully be on the supply list for schools around the area. And hopefully, I will already have a full-time position at a school.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h4>Q- Do you have any advice for someone who is entering your program?</h4>
		<p>A- Don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions; especially on controversial topics! These issue that you are dealing with will only help you relate to your future students. The ability to further discuss differences will also benefit you greatly not just in school, but in everyday life. I would also reccomend talking to your teachers regulary because whatever you are going through in school, they have as well. So seek out advice often. Finally, I would suggest going out and getting active in the school, and try to meet new people. Some of the people you meet in university will be the people that stick with you until graduation (and sometimes even further). So go out and aactually talk to your classmates!</p>
